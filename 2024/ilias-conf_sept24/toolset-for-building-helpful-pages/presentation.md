Strategies and best practices can prevent pages like this.

Let's rewind...

---

<!-- _class: chapter-01 -->

## **A fresh start is wonderful**

---

![bg left:50% fit](img/meme_endless-possibilities.gif)

I ❤️ a brand-new

* computer
* paper planner
* renovated home

---

![bg right:50% fit](img/meme_this-time-good.webp)

A new chance, when everything

* can still be the way I want it to be
* is not yet overwhelming
* the everyday chaos has not yet taken over

---

## But how does it end...

![bg right:50% fit](img/meme_messy-room.jpg)

---

One day a renovated home will...

* be a bit messy
* need compromises with the other people living there
* have boxes in the basement where no one is sure how they got there, but what if we need that old DVD player to watch a DVD and the ice cream maker and the surf board, so we really can't throw these away.

---

This could happen to an ILIAS installation

* from clear to overwhelming
* from pretty to ugly
* from expertly managed to everyone doing their own thing

---

<!-- _class: chapter-01 -->

## **How can we keep things from getting messy?**

---

<!-- _class: chapter-01 -->

## **We have seen systems go messy and back**

---

* Ferdinand Engländer - frontend-developer
* CaT Concepts and Training GmbH
* we run ILIAS instances modified and specialized for businesses
* insurances, car manufacturers, mid-size to large organizations,...

### **Coming to terms with**
## **uncomfortable truths**

---

With regards to all users 

* **most users use ILIAS because they have to, not because they like it**
* possible misunderstanding: they manage to use it = everything is fine
* how can we make it a system that everyone likes to use
  * initially
  * long term

---

With regards to managing users

* **the freedom in ILIAS can be a curse**
* many ways to paint yourself into a corner
* different creators might have completely different ideas of how to use the system

---

<!-- _class: chapter-01 -->

## **Let's make an effective ILIAS together**

---

* Making decisions based on use cases
* Pitfalls of unclear structure
* Using the Page Editor effectively together
  * Helpful (not just appealing) design
  * Content Style Blocks
  * Templates
  * Communicating strategies
* Breaking the limits
  * Styling blocks through the system style
  * cate trainings search

---

<!-- _class: chapter-01 -->

## **Making decisions based on use cases**

---

Who wants/needs to create ILIAS content?
* groups (IT, product development, knowledge management)
* individuals (leaders, trainers, experts)
* What's their familiarity with ILIAS?

---

What is the motive and target group size?
* mandatory (regulations & laws, IDD time) vs. nice to have (internal processes, personal development)
* general (widespread) vs. specific (just to whom it may concern) information

---

What update and teaching cycles do exist for which group?
* on rare occasion
* on frequent occasion
* yearly
* monthly
* weekly

---

What teaching styles/methods are most likely being used for which content?
* mandatory, yearly update, seen by many, avoids costly mistakes
  * = videos, interactive content/quiz, SCORM course from external media company
* expert gives impulse lecture, seen by few, knowledge might benefit some
  * = webinar, recorded presentation

---

How much time and money can we spent on a page or piece of content - depends on
* target group size
* update and teaching frequency
* measurable gain

Wie plant man mit Chaos

Aufwand bei Inhalte und gestaltete Seiten

Payback von Zeitinvestionen

---

Vor und Nachteile von verschiedenen Strukturierungen

nach Jahr (Bilder machen keinen Sinn)
nach Thema (Bilder können bei Orientierung helfen)
nach Aufgabenbereich
nach Zielgruppe

<!-- _class: chapter-01 -->

## **Structure**

---

* a clear structure is a non-verbal instruction
* can combat decent into chaos
* sometimes a click path is quicker than a search

---

* Some possible structures
  * by year
  * by topics
  * by type (live webinar, SCORM course, in person, recordings)
  * by target audience
  * by action (learn, teach, change settings)...

---

By year

* e.g. 2021 / 2022 / 2023 > 01 January
* at some point needs a sub-structure
* doesn't indicate much about the content (was X a client/product in 2022)
* very helpful where up-to-date content is vital (recent regulations, yearly line of products)

---

By topics

* e.g. Product Development / Lead Generation / Product Line > Consumer Models, Industry Models
* very human-friendly
* too many or ambiguous topics can cause confusion
* possible divide of relevant to many vs. relevant to a few = alphabetical sort might not be the best

---

<!-- _class: dont-fade-bullet-points -->

## <i class="fa fa-edit"></i> Your turn

* What structure of categories do we use where?
  * by topics, by type (live webinar, SCORM course, in person, recordings), by target audience, by action (learn, teach, change settings)...
* Where do we break this structure and why?
* Where do we have patterns that should stay consistent (e.g. in description or page content of a courses always starting with "Speaker:")

## **Using the Page editor**

---

## Just generated elements

---

<!-- _footer: "" -->
<!-- _header: "" -->

![bg fit](img/cate_Structure-plain-list_2024-08-14_10-23.png)

---

<!-- _footer: "" -->
<!-- _header: "" -->

![bg fit](img/cate_too-many-tiles.png)

---

* List of items (e.g. categories) has no weighting
* Even cards have no weighting

---

## Using the page editor to build overviews

---

<!-- _footer: "" -->
<!-- _header: "" -->

![bg fit](img/cate_featured-tiles.png)

---

<!-- _class: dont-fade-bullet-points -->

## <i class="fa fa-edit"></i> Your turn

* Which places in your ILIAS benefit from featured sections?

---

## Overviews can also promote actions

* Suggestion: Say "hello" in the company Slack
* Contact if you have questions
