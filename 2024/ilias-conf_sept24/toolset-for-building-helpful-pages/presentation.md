A new chance, when everything

* can still be the way I want it to be
* is not yet overwhelming
* the everyday chaos has not yet taken over

One day a renovated home will...

* be a bit messy
* need compromises with the other people living there
* have boxes in the basement where no one is sure how they got there, but what if we need that old DVD player to watch a DVD and the ice cream maker and the surf board, so we really can't throw these away.

---

This could happen to an ILIAS installation

* from clear to overwhelming
* from pretty to ugly
* from expertly managed to everyone doing their own thing

  * initially
  * long term

With regards to managing users

* **the freedom in ILIAS can be a curse**
* many ways to paint yourself into a corner
* different creators might have completely different ideas of how to use the system

## **Structure**

---

<!-- _class: dont-fade-bullet-points -->

## <i class="fa fa-edit"></i> Your turn

* What structure of categories do we use where?
  * by topics, by type (live webinar, SCORM course, in person, recordings), by target audience,...
* Where do we break this structure and why?
* Where do we have patterns that should stay consistent (e.g. in description or page content of a courses)
