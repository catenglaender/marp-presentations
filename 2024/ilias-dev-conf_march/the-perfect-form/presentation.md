### Helpful

* it's like a language we share with the user
* if we speak their language, the users feel at home

---

### Challenge

* like a language it can be used incorrectly
* sometimes creating something good requires multiple drafts
* misunderstandings happen

---

<!-- _class: chapter-01 -->

## **The perfect form?**

---

## It depends...

* like with language there is one answer to write the perfect poem, essay or paper
* Does it do, what it is supposed to do?

---

## There is more than one way

## Which one is the best in *this* case?

## **Evidence-based design choices**

---

# Problem with design

If it's about beauty, it's up to feelings and preferences.

---

# UI is not about beauty!

It's about if users can use the interface
* quick
* no errors
* achieving their goal

UI is about a good UX.
This is measurable!

---

# Studies & user testing

* eye-tracking (path & fixations)
* number of errors
* time
* checkpoints / success rate

---

# Helpful Sources

* Luke Wroblewski, Web Form Design - Filling in the Blanks, 2008, New York, Rosenfeld Media

### An interesting thing to talk about

* with this very important point to consider
  * and a nested bullet point here
* and here is another one that needs a couple lines of text to really make clear what it is all about and why whe whould consider this
* three bullet points is a good amount of bullet points for a slide

### A slide next to an image

It could be

* an impressive screenshot there
* a hilarious meme
* or a picture of a cute and cuddly kitten, because why not
